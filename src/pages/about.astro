<p>
	👋 I'm a 23-year-old software developer from Finland, trying to create and finish experiences with a bad track record of doing so. Since 2016, I've honed <strong>7 years of hands-on experience</strong> in:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>🎮 Game engine architecture (Unity 3D/Godot GDScript)</li>
	<li>🛠️ Networked gameplay systems (RageMP C# servers, SA:MP pawn scripting)</li>
	<li>🕹️ Low-poly modeling and rendering pipelines (Blender + HLSL shaders)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Currently building:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>🔫 A PSX-styled FPS in Unity, trying to re-create the PS1 era graphical style</li>
	<li>🚗 Open:MP roleplay server with Pawn language</li>
</ul>

<p>
	When not coding, I enjoy gaming and listening to music. I'm also a huge fan of 3D modeling which I am trying to learn to do well in Blender.
</p>

<p>
	Obsessed with the idea of being able to create anything I can imagine, I'm always looking for new ways to express myself through code and art.
